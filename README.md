## What is codegames?
Codegames is an online unofficial replica of the board game [codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenamescodenames). This github repo consists of the source for said game. The original game was designed by [Vlaada Chv√°til](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/789/vlaada-chvatil).
## Why codegames?
Codegames was made with customization in mind from the start, we were inspired by codenames to create something that allows a framework for creating your own codenames experience. That is why we are introducing custom packs with codegames, a way to customize your experience so it fits your group of friends with words that you chose in the language you choose.

## Where is the source code?
This github repo has the source code of the game. It is split into two parts one for the backend (server) running nodejs and one for the frontend (client). Both are js-based and the client uses html and css for display. They are connected using socket.io. The server and client are both made opensource under the MIT license because we expect you to do cooler things with this than what we have done. There is a server running so you can create your own client to connect to our server, and you can connect to your own server too if thats what you fancy.
