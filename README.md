## What is codegames?
Codegames is an online unofficial replica of the board game [codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenamescodenames). This github repo consists of the source for said game. The original game was designed by [Vlaada Chv√°til](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/789/vlaada-chvatil).
## Why codegames?
Codegames was made with customization in mind from the start, we were inspired by codenames to create something that allows a framework for creating your own codenames experience. That is why we are introducing custom packs with codegames, a way to customize your experience so it fits your group of friends with words that you chose in the language you choose.
